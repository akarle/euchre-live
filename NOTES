NOTES
=====

Just some implementation details / thoughts.


In an OOP world...
------------------

Game has
    Teams has
        score
        Players have
            is_dealer
            will_start
            tricks_won
            Hand has
                Cards has
                    id
                    name

In a functional world...
------------------------
Key: cards are just ints (can derive class/value from int)

subs:
    trick_winner
    score_tricks/round
    deal_hands

global state:
    leader
    dealer_id
    calling_team
    trump_suit
    scores[2]
    tricks[4]

Round:
  1. deal cards
  2. <Vote trump>
  3. leader = 1
  4. for i 0..5 # play hand
      a. <accept input x 4>
      b. leader = trick_winner, tricks[$winner]++
  5. scores += score_round(tricks)
  6. If max(scores) >= 10 -- DONE

(note: <> means interactive)
