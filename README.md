euchre.live
===========

For my family <3

Euchre is our "family game", and with the COVID-19 social-distancing, we're
suddenly unable to play.

Disappointed with the state of the online options, we decided to make our own.

Installation
------------
Install `npm`, `cpanminus`, and Perl. Then:

```sh
$ npm i
$ cpanm --installdeps .
```

Running
-------
```sh
$ ./run.sh
```
