euchre.live
===========

For my family <3

Euchre is our "family game", and with the COVID-19 social-distancing, we're
suddenly unable to play.

Disappointed with the state of the online options, we decided to make our own.

Installation
------------
First, get a working Perl and cpanm.

  $ cpanm --installdeps .

Running
-------
Run the development server as so:

   $ ./gloat.pl daemon
